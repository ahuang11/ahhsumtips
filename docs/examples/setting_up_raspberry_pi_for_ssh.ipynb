    "### Setting Up Raspberry Pi for SSH\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Headless (no keyboard/monitor/ethernet connected to Pi) setup to open SSH for local network\n",
    "https://caffinc.github.io/2016/12/raspberry-pi-3-headless/\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download a Raspberry OS and unzip it (I chose RASPBIAN STRETCH LITE) https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/\n",
    "2. Download and install Win32DiskImager from https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download\n",
    "3. Run Win32DiskImager and write the unzipped OS to the drive letter corresponding to your SD card http://www.raspberry-projects.com/pi/pi-operating-systems/win32diskimager\n",
    "4. In This PC (on Windows 10), go into \"SDCARD:\\\" (where SDCARD is the drive letter of your SD card)\n",
    "5. Right click inside that drive folder, click New -> Text Document, and rename the \"New Text Document.txt\" to \"ssh\" WITHOUT the .txt!\n",
    "6. Repeat step 5, but instead, rename another \"New Text Document.txt\" file to \"wpa_supplicant.conf\"\n",
    "7. Open \"wpa_supplicant.conf\" and paste these lines in there:\n",
    "        ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\n",
    "        update_config=1\n",
    "\n",
    "        network={\n",
    "            ssid=\"SSID\"\n",
    "            psk=\"PASSWORD\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Replace \"SSID\" with your wifi's name and \"PASSWORD\" with the wifi's password\n",
    "9. Mount your SD card to your Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "10. Try to figure out what the Rasberry Pi's IP address is through your router's gateway (or set up static IP)\n",
    "11. You can now \"ssh pi@IPADDRESS\" with the default password \"raspberry\"\n",

    "#### Beyond local; securing the SSH for the whole wide web \n",

    "\n",
    "12. Encrypt your wifi password (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md)\n",
    "13. Create new user and disable \"pi\"\n",
    "14. If new user's default shell isn't bash, type \"sudo chsh -s /bin/bash NEWUSER\"\n",
    "15. Make sudo require a password\n",
    "16. Set up SSH key login; how /etc/ssh/sshd_config could look like\n",
